        <p>The “Classical Liberalists” are a team of intellectual IGCSE Global Perspectives students who have carried
          out various research works to achieve their goal of evaluating health inequality.“Students of Greensprings
          School Anthony: Ayooluwa, Tise and Dunmomi are IGCSE Global Perspectives candidates
          who saw a problem in their society and have e valuated their research findings to create a conclusive outcome.
          These students researched on the effects of health inequality on the less privileged and they have outdone
          themselves by joining forces to begin a fundraiser and spark a movement among their peers on this issue.”
          _Doctor Obidahunsi (Interviewee’s review of team project)</p>
        <p><strong>Ayooluwa:</strong> Working with my team has been a very motivating and uplifting experience. We
          specially named our
          team “The Classical Liberalists” because we believe that according to America’s Constitution all men are born
          same and equal. We are all entitled to the same well-equipped health facilities and should not be denied such
          due to unequal social status.</p>
        <p><strong>Tise:</strong> In my view, healthcare is neither a right nor a privilege. A right to health care
          implies that the
          force of law can justifiably be used to force health care providers to deliver services regardless of cost and
          regardless of the opinions and circumstances of those who provide the service. In addition this usually means
          that taxpayers are also forced to provide the funds to pay for services provided - whether or not they would
          do so voluntarily or not.</p>
        <p><strong>Dunmomi:</strong> A privilege implies that a person seeking health care does so by permission, or at
          least as a less
          than equal partner in the relationship between patient and care giver. It is reasonable however to state that
          everyone has the right to SEEK health care from providers and every health care provider has the right to
          OFFER services. It is also reasonable to state that both sides of the relationship between provider and
          consumer must enter into the relationship in good faith and conduct themselves in a fair and reasonable way -
          the same as for any economic transaction.</p>
