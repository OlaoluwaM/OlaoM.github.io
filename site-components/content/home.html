          <p>Poverty refers to the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs such as food,
            clothing and shelter. Poverty is drastically influenced by the great disparity in the socio economic strata
            as a result of Inequality in our society. The paper suggests that inequality and poverty affect each other
            directly and indirectly but also influence other sectors such as the medical sector.</p>
          <p> In todayâ€™s society there are several factors which limit adequate access to healthcare for everyone
            regardless of status. One of the glaring problems is the poverty resulting in lack of funds and the
            inequality. Our desire was to discover the limitation wealth and prominence has when it comes to quality
            healthcare provision as we concentrate on those below the poverty line compared to those who are extremely
            wealthy so as to grasp enough information. </p>

        <p>Our team is interested in exploring how poverty and inequality aid the restrictions in access to healthcare
          availability with the use of various perspectives. This team project is worth the while because we all have
          visited hospitals in one way or another so we have a few ideas and thoughts on the limitation each of us has
          faced in hospitals of both the private and public sector.</p>
