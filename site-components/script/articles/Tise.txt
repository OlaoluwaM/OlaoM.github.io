Our IGCSE Global Perspectives Team project has provided me with the opportunity to expand my horizon in the terms of access to Healthcare facilities. It is an unfortunate phenomenon that our society suffers from poverty and Inequality and these results in many people below the socio economic boundary to find accessibility to good healthcare very difficult. Solutions such as subsidizing healthcare for the underprivileged will help to provide adequate Healthcare.
Moreover, this can only be achieved if we all unite in order to eradicate the inequality barriers from the society. This website is our outcome to spread awareness and offer solutions such as our fundraiser and an insight into the lives of those we interviewed who suffer from this problem. I believe healthcare is a right which should not be infringed upon by corruption or social discrimination.
