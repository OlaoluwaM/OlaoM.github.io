<p>Governments do not have their own money - they merely distribute the money of the people who pay taxes. Since the demand on health care is infinite (we all want the best healthcare for our children even though we restrict their access to the best schools, food and the safest cars because of cost) any such right to healthcare must be restricted according to what the population can afford to pay.
Alternatively, if we were to require the providers to provide such services, which would mean they would have to serve at times when they do not wish to do so or at reduced cost, then these people are being conscripted to work or being required to subsidize the public purse, which is a deprivation of their rights.</p>
<p>The original American concept of rights - to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is authentic. It embodied the idea that individuals have the right to their own lives, the freedom to act in support of it, and to pursue happiness as each construes that idea. It was not a guarantee that you will live and be happy, only that you are free to act in support of these things to rise up and spark a change in our society.</p>
